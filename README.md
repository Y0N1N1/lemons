# lemons

Lemons is a python library for the non-normies of the dl community. You can help and use the code at any time under the mit license, all helps apreciated! 

### Use
Lemons has yet to launch as we are just starting. We havent got much yet, and its full of errors. 
if you want you can:
```
pip install git@github.com:Y0N1N1/lemons.git
```
### Motivation
The main frameworks for building neural nets that give a great level of freedom are obviously Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch and others, yet these offer solutions in a very standardized way where the users can only choose from the options offered. Lemons aims to offer a less professional approach, where anyone in the community can write other optimizers, loss functions, activation functions, neural networks, and lemons will simply be a library with the purpose to have any models for anyone. Implementations of all kinds of models will be accepted. A future plan would be to have a machine learning marketplace where anyone can post models for free.

### Example
Here is a simple NN example
```python
import lemons as lm 
# still to do 
```
